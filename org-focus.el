;;; Commentary:
;;
;; It adds an extra field to the SCHEDULED property in org-mode:
;;
;; * TODO Test
;;   SCHEDULED: <2016-05-01 Sun> <1 hour>
;;
;; You schedule an item in for a day and then set a plan of how long
;; you expect to spend on it.
;;
;; We add an extra property specific to this workflow called ESTIMATE,
;; which pertains the the task overall.
;;
;; * TODO Test
;;   ESTIMATE: <2 hours>
;;   SCHEDULED: <2016-05-01 Sun> <1 hour>
;;   SCHEDULED: <2016-05-02 Mon> <1 hour>
;;
;; This allows us to have a task that spans many days, with an overall
;; estimate. Then each day that you're working on the task, you can
;; put in an amount of time you plan to spend on it (either hopeful or
;; a pestimate, as you prefer).
